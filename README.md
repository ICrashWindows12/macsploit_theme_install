# Installation
1. Run this to get access to install themes (normal way)
```bash
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ICrashWindows12/macsploit_theme_install/main/macsploit_theme_selection.sh" | Bash
```
or run this (beta mode). Slightly modified
```bash
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ICrashWindows12/macsploit_theme_install/main/macsploit_theme_selection.sh" | Bash
```

3. A window will pop up prompting you what you want theme you want to install
4. Select either `Hacker-Style UI` or `TV Static UI`. Running `beta mode` will also give an option for `Credits`
5. Once you clicked to select an option, click Ok and you will go through the installation process
6. Open up Macsploit (A paid exploit) and you can see the theme in effect

# Notes
- If macsploit is open, restart macsploit (close and open) to see the theme in effect
- Im not paid to do this. I just do this for fun.

# Things I want to achieve
- Get a custom role in discord server (the one for macsploit)
